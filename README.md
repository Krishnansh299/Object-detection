# Object-detection

This program can be used for object detction purposes.
It is built with the help of opencv.
It is trained with the help of coco.names,frozen inference graph and latest ssd mobilenet dataset which provides the best balance between speed and accuracy.
It can be used for object detection in pre-recorded videos as well as live webcam.
Although the model perform really well on some datatsets,it needs to be further trained in order to identify the objects that are beyond its dataset
